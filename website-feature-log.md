## Item Lifecycle & Status Transitions

```
seller submits item
    ↓
pending_valuation
    ↓ admin approves (sets price, category, oversized flag)
    ↓                                  ↘ admin rejects → item hidden, seller notified
    ↓                                  ↘ admin requests info → needs_info (seller sees alert)
    ↓                                      → seller resubmits → back to pending_valuation
    ↓                                      → admin cancels → back to pending_valuation
pending_logistics
    ↓
    ├─ Pro seller: confirm_pickup → select week → pay $15 → available
    └─ Free seller: admin confirms capacity → available (or rejects → upgrade offered)
                                           ↓
                                       available
                                           ↓ buyer purchases (Stripe)
                                         sold
                                           ↓ admin marks payout sent
                                       payout_sent=True
```

### Operational Milestones (tracked separately, don't affect item status)
- `picked_up_at` — when item was collected from seller
- `arrived_at_store_at` — when item physically arrived at warehouse/store

### Reservations
- **Not a status** — tracked via separate `ItemReservation` model
- Non-binding, has expiry timestamp (`expires_at`)
- One active reservation per item at a time
- Buyer can cancel; reservation can expire automatically
- `expiry_email_sent` tracks whether expiry notification was sent

## Seller Activation Flows

### Pro Seller (`collection_method='online'`)
1. Submit item → `pending_valuation`
2. Admin approves → `pending_logistics`, seller emailed with final price
3. Seller goes to `/confirm_pickup` → selects pickup week → enters address/phone
4. Pay $15 via Stripe → `has_paid=True`
5. Webhook confirms → items become `available`
6. Additional oversized items: $10 each via `/pay_oversize_fee/<id>` (first oversized included in $15)

### Free Tier Seller (`collection_method='free'`)
1. Submit item (max 3 items) → `pending_valuation`
2. Admin approves → `pending_logistics`
3. Admin reviews capacity → Confirm or Reject
4. **Confirmed:** seller picks up week + address → items `available`, 20% payout
5. **Rejected:** seller offered alternative to upgrade to Pro ($15/50%)

### Guest Account Flow
- Guests can begin onboarding without an account
- Progress saved via session + `/onboard/guest/save`
- Account created at step 10-11 (or via Google OAuth)
- Guest can also set password later from dashboard (`/set_password`)

- **413:** Payload too large (file upload exceeds limit)

### Health Check (`/health`)
- JSON response: `status` (healthy/unhealthy), `database` (connected), `stripe` (configured), `resend` (configured), `timestamp`
- Used by Render for monitoring/load balancer

### File Serving
- `/uploads/<filename>` — serves uploaded files from `/var/data/` (production) or `static/uploads/` (local)

### Share Card Image (`/share/item/<id>/card.png`)
