        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Every spring, college campuses across America face the same wasteful cycle. As students pack up their dorms, perfectly good furniture—couches, mini-fridges, desks, mattresses, and more—ends up in dumpsters and landfills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Students invest hundreds of dollars in furniture at the start of the academic year, only to abandon it months later when they move out. Meanwhile, incoming students spend hundreds more purchasing the same items brand new. This cycle repeats year after year, creating massive waste and unnecessary expense.
        </p>
        <p>
            The environmental impact is staggering. Thousands of tons of usable furniture are discarded annually, contributing to landfill overflow and unnecessary manufacturing demand. This waste represents not just environmental harm, but also significant financial loss for students and missed opportunities for sustainable consumption.
        </p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
        Campus Swap revolutionizes this broken system by creating a circular economy for campus furniture. Instead of discarding perfectly good items, students can easily list their furniture through our platform. We handle pickup, storage, and resale, ensuring items find new homes rather than landfills.
    </p>
    <p>
        For sellers, Campus Swap transforms abandoned furniture into income. When your item sells, you receive 40% of the sale price—money that would otherwise be left on the curb. The process is simple: snap a photo, schedule a pickup, and get paid when your item finds a new owner.
    </p>
    <p>
        For buyers, Campus Swap provides access to affordable, quality furniture without the hassle of moving heavy items yourself. Everything is stored safely, priced fairly, and ready when you need it. You get the furniture you need at a fraction of retail cost, while supporting a sustainable alternative to new purchases.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the environment, Campus Swap creates a meaningful impact. Every item we save from a landfill reduces waste, decreases manufacturing demand, and promotes sustainable consumption practices. By extending the life cycle of furniture, we're building a more sustainable future for college campuses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Campus Swap benefits everyone involved: students earn money from items they'd otherwise discard, buyers access affordable furniture, and together we're building a more sustainable campus community.
