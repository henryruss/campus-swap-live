    <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.6; color: #555;">
        Campus Swap started when we saw hundreds of perfectly good couches being thrown into dumpsters during move-out week. 
        <br><br>
        We realized there was a better way. We built a system to rescue these items, store them over the summer, and sell them back to incoming students at a fraction of the retail price.
        <br><br>
        We are built by students, for students.
