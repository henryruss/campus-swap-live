    <h2>The Problem We Saw</h2>
    <p>
        Every spring, college campuses across America face the same wasteful cycle. Students pack up their dorms, and perfectly good furniture—couches, mini-fridges, desks, mattresses—ends up in dumpsters. We watched this happen at our own schools and realized: <strong>this doesn't have to be the way it works.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Students spend hundreds of dollars on furniture at the start of the year, only to abandon it months later. Incoming students then spend hundreds more buying the same items brand new. It's wasteful, expensive, and completely unnecessary.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="about-section">
    <h2>Our Solution</h2>
    <p>
        Campus Swap bridges the gap between move-out and move-in. Instead of throwing your furniture away, you snap a photo and we handle the rest. We pick up your items, store them over the summer, and sell them to incoming students. When your item sells, you get 40% of the sale price—money you'd otherwise leave on the curb.
    </p>
    <p>
        For buyers, Campus Swap means affordable, quality furniture without the hassle of moving it yourself. Everything is stored safely, priced fairly, and ready when you need it.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="about-section">
    <h2>Why We're Different</h2>
    <p>
        We're not a corporation. We're college students who experienced this problem firsthand. We know what it's like to lug a mini-fridge down three flights of stairs, only to realize you can't take it with you. We know the frustration of paying full price for furniture you'll only use for a year.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>That personal experience drives everything we do.</strong> We've built Campus Swap to be simple, fair, and genuinely helpful—because we're solving a problem we've lived through ourselves.
    </p>

<div class="about-section">
    <h2>Where We're Growing</h2>
    <p>
        We started at Davidson College, where we saw immediate demand from both sellers and buyers. The concept resonated because it solves a real problem students face every year. Now we're expanding to UNC Chapel Hill and planning to bring Campus Swap to campuses nationwide.

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
        We believe move-out doesn't have to be wasteful. We believe students deserve to get paid for their furniture, and incoming students deserve affordable options. Most importantly, we believe in creating a sustainable cycle that benefits everyone involved.
    </p>
    <p>
        Campus Swap is more than a business—it's a movement toward smarter, more sustainable campus living. Every item we save from a landfill, every dollar we put back in a student's pocket, every affordable piece of furniture we provide to an incoming student moves us closer to that vision.
